## My neovim configuration

Historically this repo has been compatible with vim8 and neovim, but if you are
reading this now, the configuration has been ported to lua and compatibility
with vim has been dropped.  The last vim-compatible commit has been tagged vim.

This is a living configuration and is constantly being tweaked, so use at your
own peril.  The included plugins, keymaps, colors and configurations are subject
to change with every commit.
